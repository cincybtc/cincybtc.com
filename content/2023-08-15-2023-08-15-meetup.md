### Notes

- There are normally food trucks at Fabled, but not on Tuesdays so you can bring your own food or snacks if you want (as long as you are buying drinks!).
- Fabled does not do table reservations, so hopefully some people can wear their bitcoin shirts or hats and new people can find the group (it's a small place).
