### Agenda

Come and hang out!

No agenda. Just meet and drink with other Bitcoin-minded people in Cincy. Ask Bitcoin-related questions, or just talk about anything.

We're usually at the long tables in the back, or in the back patio area if it's nice out.

### Location & Time

We're meeting at **Woodburn Brewing** from 7pm to 9pm (roughly).

Woodburn Brewing
2800 Woodburn Ave ¬∑ Cincinnati, OH
