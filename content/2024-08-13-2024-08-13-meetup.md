### Details

Our friends [FreeMarketKids](https://www.freemarketkids.com/) from Louisville are coming up to show us a few of their fun Bitcoin-related games: Hodl Up, Channel Up, and BIP39.

Free pizza üçï provided, because why not?

This is a newbie-friendly Bitcoin meetup where we'll play some easy-to-learn games that can teach you more about Bitcoin, and are fun whether you know about it or not!
