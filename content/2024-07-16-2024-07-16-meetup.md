### Details

Why did the 2008 financial crisis kick off the creation of Bitcoin? What problem does Bitcoin actually solve?

This is a newbie-friendly Bitcoin meetup where we'll learn about the economic side of Bitcoin. Dumb questions are welcome.

### Location & Time

We're meeting at **WHSE**, also known as The Warehouse, from 7pm to 9pm (roughly).

**How to find us**
Go to the parking lot behind/on the side of the building, then look for the door by the loading dock on the corner. The door says "WAREHOUSE" above it. That's the entrance.
