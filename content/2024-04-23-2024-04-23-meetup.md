### Agenda

Lowkey hangout at Madtree in Oakley. No agenda, just chat.

Come and hang with some Bitcoiners and discuss Bitcoin, the halving, or any other topic (except other crypto‚Äîit's a Bitcoin-only meetup).

We'll find a table or two in the outside area. If it's your first time and you don't know anyone, look for the table that has a Bitcoin sign on it!
